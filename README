INSTALLATION

has two modules, i2b2-export-service (the server side) and i2b2-export-plugin 
(the client side). See their respective README files for details on how to

COMPILING FROM SOURCE CODE

The source code is available from 
${project.distributionManagement.repository.url}.

This software uses the Maven build system version 3.2.5 or later, available 
from http://maven.apache.org. You must install maven, if you do not already
have it, to work with the source code.

While building this software, maven will connect to Oracle's maven repository
to download a copy of Oracle's JDBC driver. For this to be successful, you will
need to create an account with the Oracle Technology Network and supply your
username and password to maven. Follow the instructions on 
http://docs.oracle.com/middleware/1213/core/MAVEN/config_maven_repo.htm#MAVEN9012.
