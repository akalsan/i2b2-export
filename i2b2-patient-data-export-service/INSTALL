i2b2 Patient Data Export Service -- A Web Service for Exporting i2b2 Patient Data.
Department of Biomedical Informatics, Emory University

INSTALLATION

The i2b2 Patient Data Export Service runs as a standard Java web application.
It has been tested with Tomcat 7 and JBoss 4.2.2, but it is expected to work
with any standards-compliant Java application server.

To install, simply deploy the WAR file included in this distribution to the
Java application server of your choice.

APPLICATION CONFIGURATION

There are two application properties that must be configured in order for the
service to communicate with your i2b2 installation. The two properties are:

i2b2ProxyUrl - The full URL of the i2b2 proxy cell. This is usually something like:
 http://hostname/webclient/index.php. Note that the hostname should usually be
 the external hostname of the server; 'localhost' or similar tends to not work,
 especially when using HTTPS.

i2b2ServiceHostUrl - The URL where the core i2b2 services are hosted. The i2b2
 Patient Data Export Service will specify this URL as the location the i2b2 proxy
 should redirect the request to. Under most i2b2 installations, this is usually:
 http://localhost:9090.


These properties are specified in a standard Java properties file. By default,
the application looks for the file in /etc/i2b2export/i2b2export.properties.
This location can be overridden using the Java system property: i2b2export.propertiesFile

DATABASE CONFIGURATION

The i2b2 Patient Data Export Service is configured to look for a database using
the JNDI name: I2b2PatientDataExportService. You must configure your application
server to specify the connection information for the database this name maps to.

For example, in Tomcat 7, this configuration goes in the context.xml:

<Context>
...
    <Resource name="jdbc/I2b2PatientDataExportService" auth="Container"
            type="javax.sql.DataSource"
            driverClassName="JDBC_DRIVER_CLASS_NAME"
            factory="org.apache.tomcat.jdbc.pool.DataSourceFactory"
            url="JDBC_CONNECTION_URL"
            username="DB_USER" password="DB_PASS"
            initialSize="1" maxActive="3" maxIdle="3" minIdle="1"
            maxWait="-1"/>
...
</Context>
