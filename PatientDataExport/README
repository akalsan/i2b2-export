i2b2 Patient Data Export plugin, ${project.version} -- An i2b2 plugin for exporting
patient data from i2b2 to CSV files
Department of Biomedical Informatics, Emory University

OVERVIEW

This is the Patient Data Export plugin, an i2b2 plugin for exporting patient data
from i2b2 to CSV files. Users can configure the format of the CSV file using the
plugin's interface, as well as save, load, and delete configurations. More
information on doing so is available in the plugin's Help tab. The plugin
communicates with i2b2's cells via the i2b2 Patient Data Export Service, a RESTful
web service that routes requests from the plugin to the appropriate i2b2 cell,
as well as providing authentication.

REQUIREMENTS

The only requirement is an installation of i2b2 1.5. This plugin has only been
tested to work with i2b2 1.5. It has NOT been tested with any later versions.

INSTALLATION

This plugin is installed using the standard i2b2 plugin installation procedure.
For more information, see:
https://community.i2b2.org/wiki/display/webclient/Web+Client+Plug-in+Developers+Guide.

These instructions assume your i2b2 installation is rooted at /var/www/html/webclient.
This location will be referred to as $I2B2_ROOT.

1. Locate your i2b2 insallation's plugins directory: $I2B2_ROOT/js-i2b2/cells/plugins.

2. Create a new directory inside the plugins directory. This directory will be
referred to as $CUSTOM_PLUGIN_DIR.

3. In cell_config_data.js, find the 'config' map and the 'category' key. Change
the last value of the 'category' array to be $CUSTOM_PLUGIN_DIR. The plugin will
show up under this category in the i2b2 plugin list.

4. Copy the entire PatientDataExport directory into the directory created in the
previous step.

5. IMPORTANT: In PatientDataExport_ctrlr.js, change the value of i2b2.PatientDataExort.SERVICE_URL
variable to the location of the i2b2 Patient Data Export Service's REST methods
that the plugin needs to call.

6. IMPORTANT: In PatientDataExport_ctrlr.js, change the value of the i2b2.PatientDataExport.IMG_DIR
variable to the path from the web server's document root to the plugin's images
directory. Assuming the installation above, this would be:
'/webclient/js-i2b2/cells/plugins/local/PatientDataExport/assets/images'.

7. IMPORTANT: In assets/injected_screens.html, find the <img> tags where the
following files are used: blank16x16.png, move_up.png, and move_down.png. Change
the 'src' attribute to have the same value as you used in the previous step.

8. Modify $I2B2_ROOT/js-i2b2/i2b2_loader.js to add the plugin to the list of
plugins. Add the following JavaScript map to the i2b2.hive.tempCellsList array:

 { code: "PatientDataExport",
    forceLoading: true,
    forceConfigMsg: { params: [] },
    forceDir: "cells/plugins/$CUSTOM_PLUGIN_DIR"
 }

 where $CUSTOM_PLUGIN_DIR is the name of the directory you created in step 2
(where the plugin was copied to). Where you place this block determines the
order in which the plugin is displayed in the i2b2 plugin list.

This completes the installation of the Patient Data Export plugin.
